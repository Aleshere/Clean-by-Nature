*This was my very first website built for someone (cleaning company in NY area).*  


# What I have learned building this  

> Difference between tutorial projects and real life projects  
> Dealing with client requests and expectations   
> Vanilla js collapsable menu    
> Copyright auto updating each year  
> The importance of vendor prefixes in CSS    
> Use Google and Stackoverflow to solve issues on my own    
> Bespoke form creation and validation
