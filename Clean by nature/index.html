                <h2>I am Jocelyn</h2>
                <p>I have been serving the community for many years, while running a preschool home daycare in Schenectady.</p>
                <p>I was a co-owner of a very successful cleaning business for the last two years. Recognizing the growing need for a more environmentally friendly cleaning services, I spent several months researching the concept of a natural cleaning company, then saw the immense benefit this service could provide and decided to branch off, forming Clean by Nature. I am not only dedicated to the health and well-being of my clients but also to my loyal, hardworking and dedicated employees.</p>

            <dl class="faq">

                    <p class='accordion'>I have never had a cleaning service, how does it work?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        Most of our clients choose an initial cleaning to start, then switch to either weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly cleanings.  At the initial cleaning or at a one-time cleaning it usually takes 1 to 2 times longer than a routine cleaning due to the fact that it is the most labor intensive as we are working hard to bring your home or office up to an immaculate level of cleanliness.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>How does your cleaning plan work?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        At Clean by Nature we provide a totally customized cleaning plan for your home or office.  We will personally review each room you would like cleaned, list all required cleaning tasks for each room and provide a plan for what products will be used at each cleaning.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>Do you require a contract?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        No, you can start or stop your cleaning service at any time.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>Are you insured against damaged items?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        Yes, Clean by Nature is fully insured for any damage that may occur to your home or office.  Our staff will treat your belongings as we would our own.  However, in the event that an object is damaged, we direct our staff to advise the client of the damage and then we take immediate action to provide compensation.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>What are your hours of service?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        We provide service during the day between the hours of 8:30am and 3pm, and at night for businesses during the hours of 5pm and 9pm Monday through Friday.  We do provide weekend services upon request.  And you can always e-mail or leave a voicemail at anytime.  You will also receive confirmation of reservations within 24 hours of your scheduled appointment.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>What are you payment methods?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        You may pay by check or cash. Payment is due at the time of cleaning but monthly invoicing is available by request.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>Who does the cleaning?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        Our team of cleaners are professional, honest, and “green clean” trained!  They are insured in case of damage, breakage, or injury.  We pay them direct so you don’t have to worry about payroll taxes.  We take care of everything.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>Do I need to provide any cleaning products?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        No, we will bring our own eco-friendly, non-toxic products to clean and sanitize your home or office, as well as supply our own vacuum cleaner if needed.  If you prefer a certain product to be used other than what we would normally bring you can let us know and we would be happy to clean with the product you provide us with at each cleaning.
                    </div>

                    <p class='accordion'>Do I have to be home during house cleaning?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        Because we clean Monday through Friday, 8:30 am to 3pm most of our customers aren't home.  We can arrange for a method of entry and lock up that is the most comfortable for you.  We also do not mind cleaning while someone is in the home.
                    </div>
   
                    <p class='accordion'>What area do you service?</p>
                    <div class="panel">
                        We currently serve Saratoga and Schenectady Counties.
