                        Most of our clients choose an initial cleaning to start, then switch to either weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly cleanings.  At the initial cleaning or at a one-time cleaning it usually takes 1 to 2 times longer than a routine cleaning due to the fact that it is the most labor intensive as we are working hard to bring your home or office up to an immaculate level of cleanliness.
